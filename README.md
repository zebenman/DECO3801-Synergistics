# ABOUT
'Age of Deception' aims to educate young people with critical thinking skills to deal with misinformation on social media via a game. The player is the King of an empire and based on information the game provides, they must make decisions which impact the entire kingdom. Sources of information are not always reliable and hence the player must develop a habit of researching and checking for reliable answers before reaching a decision.
